# bashPractice

I'm using this repo to try to learn how to automate with bash scripts.

Day 1: made a short bash script, could not make it run.

Day 2: looked in to making it run more, still no luck. Was operating on the assumption my editer wasn't properly configured, will look into other options next time.

Day 3: We cracked the case. use `chmod +x` with an argument that's the file you want to use, then use `./`(fileName)`.sh` to run it.

Day 4: Learning how to start a java app with the script.
